About
=====

This project (Classery.co) was created for the Startup Weekend Notre
Dame hackathon on April 5-7, 2013. Brian Shourd pitched an idea, the
team was formed, and the business plan was assembled. This website and
all designs were accomplished within 54 hours of the original pitch, and
have been left as they were at the time of presentation.

Classery recieved 2nd place.

The website is nothing more than a tech demo - a proof of concept and
layout, and proof that this team could actually create the product we
were pitching. Parts of it are buggy, parts of it are fake, and there is
little in the way of functionality. Hacks and undocumented code abound.
