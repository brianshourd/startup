                <p> Description: In this course, I'll teach you to make wooden objects the way that nature intended - using the power of steel and Snickers bars. Working only by hand, I'll teach you all the techniques that you need to learn to care for, set up, and of course use your tools, from sharpening to sawing. By the end, you'll have finished your very own small project - a simple decorative jewelry box, and you'll be well on your way to mastering this delightful hobby. </p>
